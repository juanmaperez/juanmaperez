---Pizza is great but achieving the perfect pizza dough could be difficult without the right recipe.

Creating the best pizza dough is not hard in terms of effort but sometimes can take time because of the fermentation process.

## Poolish preparation

The poolish is the pre-fermentation of the dough. We will be making this preparation first and it's really important because will help to create a fluffier mix.

### Ingredients

- Water 180gr
- 00 Flour 180gr
- Fresh yeast 4gr
- Honey 3gr

### Steps

1. Dissolve the yeast in the water.
2. Add the honey and dissolve it into the water.
3. Add the flour and mix until the content is soft.
4. Leave the mix resting for 1 hour at room temperature.
5. Move it to the fridge and leave it there for 16 to 24 hours.
6. Take out of the fridge the next day and leave it resting for 20' before start preparing the dough.
