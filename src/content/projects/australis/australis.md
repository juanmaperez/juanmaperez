This project was implemented to attract people interested in this kind of destination less usual and away from the big cities. For this reason, we created blogpatagonia.australis.com a meeting point for this tourist with a wild lifestyle and completely full of adventures.

Develop this project has been like a walk on our wild side. It was easier design spectacular layouts with images as surprising as those obtained from these cruises in Cape Horn and Patagonia.

Besides, we have implement several plugins to improve their visits and provide them tools to build the best inbound marketing strategy. We have design landing pages, thank you pages and emails to inform their followers about every offer and get contact through forms in exchange for resources and information about traveling.

Responsive design is absolutely required and we proceed to create an intuitive design for them with a target on mind: upgrade UX.

To end, we can say that it was a pleasure to work in this project and develop a place where people can find interesting information about amazing places and discover new ones.
