As a part of their team, I was working on different themes for showing their products on the main website. Catalogs for different campaigns created from scratch with a given design for making it real throughout HTML, CSS and Javascript. Other functions that I had to develop were different animations or motions that interacted with users during the navigation.

An important task to implement in Oysho was to improve the productivity with internal tools. For reach this end, I was responsible of creating different scripts for the automation of the content published on the website. These scripts allowed us to build the homepage dynamically including all the different sliders and the information displayed.

As a retail company the timing was always really short what made us to work quick but always with an extra pressure for keeping an eye on all details since our website managed a lot of visit and great amounts of money from sales.
