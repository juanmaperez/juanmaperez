excerpt: "Colossus Bets is a betting company based on UK. Here is where I work nowadays implementing new features for the main app and improving the UX for the existing ones."

I have been working in different areas in the project but also focused on improvements related to how the users can set information about their profiles, stadistics, results, or bet deposits through a profile view with new features and easier to follow.

Besides we implemented an avatar uploading tool according to be more efficient in the customization of different captains profile, and increase the engagement.

Also, we had a deep process of code revision and improvements related to the load time on the website and upgrades in the Angular version we had implemented reaching finally the framework 7th version.

All that changes brought daily work with different departments into the company as graphics, back end, marketing or bussiness making me a deep view of the main application and which was the path we should take in the future for continuously growing together.
