I joined Sainsbury's as a software engineer to the Discover team in the Groceries Online department. I focused my work on improving the user's experience with the search engine regarding to usability and results obtained from each search.

The project started as a migration of the front end from a IBM Websphere to a single page application. Our goal was to improve the performance of the website, and deliver the best shopping experience in the market. 

As part of the main set of improvements, we decrease the loading times and a friendly navigation within pages, we introduced high resolution media like images and videos for the product list and the product detail page, or created a modern and attractive layout for the whole site with a better conversion rate in almost all the pages.  

After delivering the main project, we worked on a CI/CD environment where we can release new code adding new features and new pages as part of the whole transition into the new product Sainsbury's.

One of the most important tasks on position as a sofware engineer, was not only delivering a great product, but also understand the company bussines and try to think ways to increase the profit and reduce the resources when possible.
